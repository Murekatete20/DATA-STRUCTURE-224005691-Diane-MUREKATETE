# Music Festival Lineup Data Structure Project

This project demonstrates basic data structure operations in Python using a music festival lineup scenario.

## Features

- Calculates total, average, minimum, and maximum performances per stage.
- Generates a formatted report.
- Checks if the festival meets a performance threshold.
- Manages a list of band names (add, filter, sort).
- Uses arrays for performance counts.
- Handles artist records with dictionaries (update, delete, aggregate).

## File Structure

- [`music_festival_lineup.py`](music_festival_lineup.py): Main script with all logic.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Run the script:

   ```sh
   python music_festival_lineup.py
   ```

## Output

The script prints a festival report, band modifications, array/list sums, and artist records after updates.
