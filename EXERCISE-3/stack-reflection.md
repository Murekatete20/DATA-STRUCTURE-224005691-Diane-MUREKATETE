## Reflection: Why stack cannot model fairness?

A stack uses LIFO (Last-In, First-Out), meaning the last item added is the first to be removed.  
This is unfair in scenarios like queues, because those who arrive first wait longer than those who arrive last.  
Fairness requires serving in order of arrival, which stacks cannot guarantee.
