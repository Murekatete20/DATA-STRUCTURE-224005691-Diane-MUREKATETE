## Reflection: Why FIFO matches fairness in schools

FIFO (First-In, First-Out) ensures that students are served in the order they arrive.  
This models fairness because no one can skip ahead; everyone waits their turn.  
It prevents favoritism and maintains order, which is essential in school environments.
